## 1. Introduction

Welcome to example.org ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our website and services.

## 2. Information We Collect

**Personal Data**: Information you provide when you register on our site, such as your name, email address, username, and password.

**Content Data**: Any content you post, upload, or otherwise make available on the platform, including videos, comments, and interactions.

**Usage Data**: Information automatically collected when you access the site, such as IP address, browser type, operating system, pages visited, and the date/time of your visit.

**Cookies and Similar Technologies**: We may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect and store information about your preferences and browsing activities.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We may use the collected information to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve our services.
- Personalize your experience on the platform.
- Communicate with you about updates, promotions, and news.
- Monitor and analyze usage and trends to enhance user experience.
- Enforce our [Terms of Service](/terms).
- Comply with legal obligations and protect our rights.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety.

Your public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and followers‑only Loops are delivered to the servers where your followers reside, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, insofar as those followers or recipients reside on a different server than this.

When you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your following list, your followers, all your Loops, and your likes. Applications can never access your e‑mail address or password.

## 4. Disclosure of Your Information

We may share your information with:

- **Service Providers**: Third‑party vendors who assist in operating our website and providing services (e.g., hosting, data analysis, payment processing, federation).
- **Legal Obligations**: If required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

## 5. Third‑Party Services

Our platform may contain links to third‑party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by example.org. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.

## 6. Security of Your Information

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one‑way algorithm (argon2d).

However, please be aware that no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## 7. Your Choices and Rights

- **Account Information**: You may review and update your account information at any time by logging into your account settings.
- **Opt‑Out**: You can opt‑out of receiving promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in those emails.
- **Cookies**: You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.

Our services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 9. International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own. We will take appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information remains protected.

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
